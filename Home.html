      <h2>I Love Food</h2>

      <p>Food is my passion. I am an avid explorer of trying new foods that are unique to me and taste resounding to me. I usually find that the best foods are the ones that you end up cooking yourself. The reason being is that you are in charge of how you want your food to come out. It can also be difficult as well if you are not a good judge of how you want your food to come out. But that's what makes practice come in handy. Some people struggle (like myself) more with cooking than others. I would highly encourage anyone going onto social media pages or channels to help flex your cooking skills. This will come in handy if you are someone living on your own for the first time. /p>

      <h2>New Season, New Opportunities</h2>

      <p> Spring has finally sprung and now is a better time to get youself in a position to be able to get yourself in a position for new opportunities for work. Nearly three years, two locations and one pandemic later, I am still searching for work that is close to meaningful to me. I have held up a part time job in retail but I know that I can only hold onto that job for so long before it's time to move onto something bigger and better. Everyone I have met here is part of a bigger journey that I am a part of. </p>
